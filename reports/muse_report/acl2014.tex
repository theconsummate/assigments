\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This report describes the experiments performed on the technique described in \cite{conneau2017word}. Although the goal was to find slight improvements, none of the designed experiment was able to increase accuracy. The code was taken from \cite{muserepo} and modified for each experiment.

\section{Introduction}
\cite{conneau2017word} describes a method to learn a transformation matrix to map word vectors in one language into another in an unsupervised way.
