## Abstract
This paper presents modality exclusivity norms for 400 randomly selected noun words, composed by asking participants for perceptual experience ratings for five sense:
- Auditory (by hearing)
- Gustatory (by tasting)
- Haptic (by feeling through touch)
- Olfactory (by smelling)
- Visual (by seeing)

These ratings are then used to find a relationship between how a word is perceived by people in real life and the corresponding lexical attributes the given word has.



### Method for collecting perceptual ratings
- The participants were a group of 34 native speakers of English.
- A random list of 400 words taken from the MRC psycho-linguistic database.

Procedure:
- The material set was randomly split into two lists of 200 items and presented to participants for perceptual strength ratings.
- Each word was presented on a separate screen with a line that read “To what extent do you experience WORD”
- Each participant rated the word on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (greatly).
- The participants were informed that there was no right or wrong answer, and they should select the values which they feel are correct.
- The experiment was paced by the participants and generally lasted between 45 and 60 mins.

Dominant modality:
- For each word, the modality which received the highest rating was assigned as the dominant modality for that word.
- For four words, ties existed and the dominant modality was then chosen randomly from the tied values.


### Results and discussion
Basic exploratory analysis showed that the following observations:
- Visual was the most strongest modality with a mean rating of 3.54, followed next by Auditory with a mean of 2.15 while Gustatory was the most weakest with a mean rating of 0.53.
- High inter-annotator agreement was observed implying that the collected data can be considered as representative.
- The 95% Confidence Intervals were quite small (less than 0.11) implying that the data is quite reliable.

#### Modality exclusivity
It is a measure of the extent to which a particular concept is perceived through a single perceptual modality, calculated per word as the rating range divided by the sum, and extending from 0% for completely multimodal, to 100% for completely unimodal. A high score means that the word has a very specific meaning whereas a low score means that the meaning is general and depends very often on the context.

The 

##### Difference between nouns and adjectives
Modality exclusivity scores for nouns (M = 39.2%) were significantly lower than those for adjectives (M = 46.1%).
Adjectives capture very specific attributes.
Nouns are more general in their descriptive capability.
Noun concepts are more multimodal in nature than are adjective concepts..
They subsume multiple adjectives.
Eg. Smell and Pungent.

#### Perceptual Strength and lexical Characteristics
The strength in the auditory modality is the most closely related to the lexical properties of words.
Because auditory experience is negatively related or unrelated to other perceptual experience, any effects of auditory strength will pull in the opposite direction from other modalities.

Dependent Lexical Variables
Measures of word length:
- Number of syllables
- Number of phonemes
- Number of morphemes
- Number of letters
- Measures of word frequency
- Frequency count
- Contextual diversity, ie. variety of different contexts in which a word appears.

Phonological neighborhood size: number of words that can be generated by switching one phoneme.
Orthographic neighborhood size: number of words that can be generated by switching one letter
Phonographic neighborhood size: number of words in the overlap between phonological and orthographic neighbors


### What I liked about the paper
This paper describes new features (at least for me!) which can be used as additional input in a machine learning model.
The information is very data driven and every claim/hypothesis was presented with an associated experiment.


### What I disliked about the paper
The data collection is manual, so using this idea in any meaningful way would be very expensive.
No results stated about potential applications. Does it really improve performance in Language models or it is only some extra information which is useless!
