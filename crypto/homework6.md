## Problem 1
In simple terms, $P^\eta_b$ returns the encryption of the plaintext $g^b$ where $g$ is the generator chosen by the cryptosystem $S$. That is $P^\eta_b = Enc(g^b, k)$

Since $S$ is CPA-secure, it means that an adversary can't distinguish between the ciphertexts $Enc(g^0, k)$ and $Enc(g^1, k)$. This implies that the $P^\eta_0$ and $P^\eta_1$ are also indistuinguishable.
