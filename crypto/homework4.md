## Problem 1
choose a message and wait for a collision. Once it happens, xor plaintext and ciphertext to obtain E(rc) or whatever and then decrypt.

Collission can be detected simply by comparing the cipertexts

## Problem 2
vaudeney attack

## Problem 3

## Problem 4
Since o(g) is finite, $g^{o(g)} = 1$ for the group generated by g.

m is a multiple of o(g), therefore let m = k*o(g) for some natural number k.

$g^{m} = g^{k*o(g)} = (g^{o(g)})^k = (1)^k = 1$

## Problem 5
Let c be the inverse of a and let the unit element be 1. It is also given that $b^2=a$

Therefore, $ca = 1 \rightarrow cb^2=1 \rightarrow (cb)b = 1$

Since the inverse of b which is "cb" exists, it is invertible.
