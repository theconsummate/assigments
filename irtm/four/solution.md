## Task1
P(c1) = P(c2) = 2/4 = 0.5

c1 “new year”
c1 “holiday year”
c2 “work again”
c2 “never work”

Conditional Probabilities: (bins = 6)

P(new|c1) = (1+1)/(4+6) = 2/10
P(year|c1) = (1+2)/(4+6) = 3/10
P(holiday|c1) = (1+1)/(4+6) = 2/10
P(work|c1) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10
P(again|c1) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10
P(never|c1) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10

P(new|c2) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10
P(year|c2) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10
P(holiday|c2) = (0+1)/(4+6) = 1/10
P(work|c2) = (2+1)/(4+6) = 3/10
P(again|c2) = (1+1)/(4+6) = 2/10
P(never|c2) = (1+1)/(4+6) = 2/10

For the given document "never holiday",
P(d|c1) = P(c1)P(never|c1)P(holiday|c1) = (1/2)(1/10)(2/10) = 1/100 = 0.01
P(d|c2) = P(c2)P(never|c2)P(holiday|c2) = (1/2)(2/10)(1/10) = 1/100 = 0.01

The model will think that the document is equally likely to belong to either of the two classes.
